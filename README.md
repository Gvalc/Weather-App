I use html, css, and javascript to build a weather app that contains an info button leading to a page that explains the program. 
I provide a search bar that allows the user to search any city's current weather with additional features such as a 5 day forecast, current time, and a graphic of the weather. I achieved this by creating a getWeather function 
that fetches the current weather using the API "OpenWeatherMap.org". It contains an if else that would return an error message if the user mispells or provides an unknown city.
I used a displayWeather function that locates the local timezone using a string.
I incorporated a display5DayForecast using for each and if statements to calculate and display the five day forecast for the chosen city.
To test the app, search up the following URL in your browser: https://gvalc.github.io/Weather-App/Weather%20App/
